Functionalities:
1) Image file upload - performs validations at server side for file size limit, and file type
2) Delete file
3) Search for files
4) Displays a status flag after each operation, for eg. if the file upload failed, it shows a flag 'File size cannot be greater than 1Mb' or 'File should be of type image'
